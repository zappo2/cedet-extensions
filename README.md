# CEDET Extensions
Emacs extensions to the CEDET tools available in Emacs 27 or later.

# Summary:

Since Emacs 24, CEDET has been included, but it does not include the
full suite of tools.  This repository includes extensions to CEDET
that are not part of Emacs.

# Backstory:

The original CEDET is available on SourceForge and is a complete set
of development tools for Emacs which includes:
* Object system (eieio) for developing objects in Emacs
* Source code parsing, analysis, navigation, and completion engines.
* IDE features such as detection of projects with integrated build and debug features.
* Code generation through nested templates.
* UML diagram editor, autogen class diagrams from code, or gen code from class diagrams.

A subset of these tools were integrated into Emacs 23 or earlier.
